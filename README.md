# Complete It

## Features

This extension attempts to replicate the [Smart Enter/Complete Statement](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/2016.3/completing-statements.html) feature found in Jetbrains IDEs.

It has been developed with Typescript in mind. It *may* work for other C-syntax languages but has not been tested. Pull requests to support other languages are welcome.

The default keybinding is `alt+shift+enter`. I would recommend updating it to `ctrl+shift+enter` to mirror Jetbrains functionality.

## Examples

//TODO

## Extension Settings

There is one setting for the extension:

`complete-it.formatDocument` - Controls whether or not to format the current document on smart enter.

## Issues

Please open an issue on Github if you encounter any weirdness.
